# NextJS-E-commerce

This project wasnt made using any type of tutorial and its not part of any exercise or job.

My goal when starting this project was to test my knowledge and challenge myself with the various problems that arise during a real development.

## Technologies and languages used in the project

This project is using: \
-NextJS. \
-ReactJS. \
-Typescript \
-Javascript \
-Bcrypt. \
-Json web token. \
-MongoDB. \
-Styled Components. \
-Css. \
-Html sintaxe. \
-Some others...

## Work in progress

I'm mostly done with the functionality part, now i'm going to be focussing on the styling.
I want this website to be prettier than the last one, so I'll be slowly changing its styles until I get a satisfactory result.
